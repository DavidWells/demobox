Demobox has 19 color pallets (from
[Google's material ui](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette))
and 18 font pairings (from femmebot's
[google type project](http://femmebot.github.io/google-type/)). These can be
used in any combination. The following screenshots display these colors
and fonts in example combinations.

The "head" font is the one used to identify a font pair. For example, to get
the first example, you would have in your header:

```
colors: red
fontPair: Alfa Slab One
```
